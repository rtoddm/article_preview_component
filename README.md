## Overview

This is a project that I completed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website is an article preview component for an interior design website. 

### Links

- Live Site URL: ([Preview Component](https://rtoddm.github.io/article_preview_component/))

## My process

1. I began by initializing my project as a public repository on [GitHub]((https://github.com/rtoddm/article_preview_component)).
2. Then I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address (GitHub pages).
3. I looked through the designs in order to plan how I'd tackle the project. This step is important to help you think through potential CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. However, before worrying about any styles, I structured my HTML content.
5. I then wrote out the basic styles for my project such as `font-family` and `font-size`, etc.
6. Then I started adding CSS styles to the top of the page and worked down.
7. Once I had my HTML and CSS in place I began working on my JavaScript and adding functionality to the website. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project really helped me to better understand the connection between the HTML and CSS of a project. Instead of simply coding out the mobile site and then moving on to the destop version I learned the importance of 
looking at each version and understanding how the functionality of both need to be considered and integrated into the structure of your HTML from the get go.

### Continued development

Moving forward I will continue to complete additional projects ustilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
